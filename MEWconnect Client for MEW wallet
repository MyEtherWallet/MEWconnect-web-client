MEWconnect Client for MEW wallet
MEWconnect Demo

With the MEWconnect client, users can use your DApp in any desktop browser without installing an extension. Additionally, end-to-end encryption using client-side generated keys keeps all user activity private.

The client provides a web3 instance so for DApp developers to integrate with MEW wallet using MEWconnect, all you need to do is drop a few lines of code into your application, and the MEW wallet app and MEWconnect client will take care of the rest.

When integrating please use the image assets located here and shown under design in the sidebar

Note that the MEWconnect Client is known to work on Ethereum testnets, but it is only officially supported on the Ethereum Mainnet.
